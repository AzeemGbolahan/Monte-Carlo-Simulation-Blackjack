/**
 * Author: Azeem Gbolahan
 * 
 * File: Simulation.java
 * 
 * Description:
 * This program provides two main options:
 * 1. Allows the user to play an interactive game of Blackjack through the terminal.
 * 2. Runs automatic simulations of Blackjack games (100, 1000, or 10,000 rounds) to determine 
 *    the player's win rate, dealer's win rate, and draw frequency using Monte Carlo simulation.
 * 
 * Menu Options:
 * - "Play Interactive Game": Play one round at a time, inputting "hit" or "stand" as the player.
 * - "Run Simulations": Automatically simulates many rounds and prints win percentages.
 * - "Exit": Closes the program.
 * 
 * This program builds on the Blackjack class, which handles game mechanics, turns, and scoring.
 * 
 * How to run:
 *   javac Simulation.java
 *   java Simulation
